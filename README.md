# Restaurant-Finder-App
Capstone final project Udacity.com

In this project, I build an app to allow users to locate restaurants around users location or entered location sorted by rating/price/distance.

# Features
First the app gets users location or an entered address.
Then the user select what type of restaurant he is looking for (Dinner,Breakfast,Lunch...).
Then the app shows list of restaurant located around user location sorted by rating/price/distance.
The user can open the restaurnt location on google maps and navigate to it.
The user can select and save restaurants as favorite and they will appear on the mainactivity (and can be added to widget).

The app used Zomado Api.

Used - java ,butterknife, json, ASyncTask, AsyncTaskLoader<Cursor>, SQLite,RecyclerView, Picasso, Content Providers, 
       Loader, Play-services-maps/location/places, widget, Design .
